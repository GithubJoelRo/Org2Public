    <p>
        One type of event that can be checked for while inside our game loop is keyboard inputs.
        A keyboard input event will be detected using the <code>pg.event.get()</code> method (assuming we had used
        <code>import pygame as pg</code> so that we don't have to fully type out "pygame" in all of our pygame methods).
    </p>
    <p class="alert quoteRed">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The following code is not actual code from the Frogger game example; some code was taken
        out to avoid confusion and streamline your understanding of keyboard input detection.
    </p>


    <pre><code>
running = True
while running:
    for event in pg.event.get():
        if event.type == pg.QUIT:
            running = False
        if event.type == pg.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pg.K_UP:
                frog.move_frog("UP")
            elif event.key == pg.K_DOWN:
                frog.move_frog("DOWN")
            elif event.key == pg.K_LEFT:
                frog.move_frog("LEFT")
            elif event.key == pg.K_RIGHT:
                frog.move_frog("RIGHT")
        </code></pre>
    <p>
        Above is an example of the game loop parsing different pygame events. In the code for TicTacToe, we only say
        events that dealt with quitting and mousedown. Now we are looking at the <code>KEYDOWN</code> event type in
        main.py. Notice that we are using a <code>for</code> loop to detect events, meaning that
        <code>pg.event.get()</code> must
        return an iterable.
        We can think of this returned iterable as a constantly-changing list of events, ordered by which event occured
        first, like a queue.
        It is constantly changing because events are always being added as we do certain things like click the screen,
        press keys, or quit the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        These events are actually objects from an Event class that is built into the pygame library.
        Instances of this underlying Event class contain information about the event itself.
        It makes sense that these are actually objects because the script variable <code>event</code> (which represents
        an Event object) has attributes that we retrieve using dot notation.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
if event.type == pg.KEYDOWN:
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <code>event.type</code> will tell us whether the event is a key press (<code>pg.KEYDOWN</code>), mouse click
        (<code>pg.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN</code>), quitting the window (<code>pg.QUIT</code>), etc.
        If the event type is indeed keyboard input, the other event attribute we will care about is
        <code>event.key</code>, which will tell us exactly which key was pressed.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
if event.key == pg.K_UP:
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        <code>pg.K_UP</code> is just pygame's way of representing the up arrow key. Notice that we have conditionals to
        catch all arrow key presses.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
if event.key == pg.K_UP: # Up Arrow Key
    frog.move_frog("UP")
elif event.key == pg.K_DOWN: # Down Arrow Key
    frog.move_frog("DOWN")
elif event.key == pg.K_LEFT: # Left Arrow Key
    frog.move_frog("LEFT")
elif event.key == pg.K_RIGHT: # Right Arrow Key
    frog.move_frog("RIGHT")
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        You are not limited to arrow key presses; check out the pygame documentation on key presses to see all of the
        key presses that you can detect: <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html">pygame.key</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that we have conditionals to catch all kinds of key presses, we can control what the game does in response
        to user keyboard input.
        You will notice that we have a call to <code>frog.move_frog</code> with every arrow key press we detect
        The <code>move_frog</code> function is a method bound to the <code>Frog</code> class that changes the
        <code>rect.x</code>, <code>rect.y</code>, and <code>lane</code> instance attributes of our frog instance,
        effectively
        moving the frog object itself.
        This is because our <code>Frog</code> class inherits from the <code>pg.sprite.Sprite</code> class, which uses
        rectangles to represent size and location. Rectangles in
        pygame have <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> attributes. When we draw a rectangle, or a Sprite that has a rect
        attribute, we use the x and y values of the rectangle to tell us where to draw. Over many iterations of the game
        loop, the drawing of a Sprite at different x,y coordinates will simulate movement.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def move_frog(self, direction):
    if (self.lane == 0 and direction == "DOWN") or # Checks if move is out of (bottom) bounds
        (direction == "LEFT" and self.rect.x - self.block_size < 0) or # Checks if move is out of (left) bounds 
        (direction == "RIGHT" and self.rect.x + self.width >= screen_width): # Checks if move is out of (right) bounds
        return None
    elif direction == "UP": # Move frog up
        self.lane += 1
        self.move_y -= self.block_size
    elif direction == "DOWN": # Move frog down
        self.lane -= 1
        self.move_y += self.block_size
    elif direction == "LEFT": # Move frog to the left
        self.move_x -= self.block_size
    elif direction == "RIGHT": # Move frog to the right
        self.move_x += self.block_size
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        Similar to the move function in the Obstacles class, the move function in the Frog class only changes the
        attributes <code>self.move_x</code> and <code>self.move_y</code>. the update function for the frog class will
        change the actual coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moving some object does not have to be the only thing that happens upon key presses.
        With the functionality of our game loops and keyboard input detection, we can make anything happen upon certain
        events; we are not limited to checking for arrow key presses and only moving objects around.
