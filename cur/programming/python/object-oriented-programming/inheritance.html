            There is one more topic we have left to discuss with regards to OOP in Python. Imagine that we want to create objects of the type <em>Textbook</em>.
            Now, a textbook is a specific type of book, right? So, it follows that it should have every attribute and method a book has, and maybe some extra stuff also.
            It would be pretty tedious and contradictory to abstraction to write all that code out again.
            Well, we don't have to! Let's take a look:

            <pre><code>
class Textbook(Book):
    publisher = 'Houghton Mifflin Harcourt'
    def random_function(self):
        return 'Do something'
            </code></pre>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            At first glance, it might seem that our new class just has a publisher and a method that...does something?<br>
            Well, load up your Python file and try the following out in the terminal:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>>>>math = Textbook('Mathematics', 'Mathematics Textbook', 'Euclid', 324)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, try asking for its language, genre, and author. What do you see? The reason for this is that Textbook is a subclass of its superclass Book, meaning that it <em>inherits</em> those attributes and methods from Book which it does not already possess.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can create as many subclasses of our main class as we want, and subclasses of those subclasses, and subclasses of those subclasses, and so on and so forth. The <strong>key</strong> idea to remember however,
            is that when you look up an attribute or a method of an object, <em>it will start looking at the bottom of the pyramid and work its way up</em>.
            So, for our example above, when we asked for the language of our math textbook, Python actually started by looking in the <em>Textbook</em> class, and when it did not find any attribute with that name,
            it went and looked in the superclass <em>Book</em>, finding it there.
