        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this lab, we will be using <a class="run"
            href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/python/algorithmic_complexity/lab7.py">this starter file</a>.&nbsp;
        We would like to add all the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code>, where <code>N</code> could
        be a big number. The obvious way to do this is to simply add them up, one by one. Complete the body of the <code>non_gauss_add</code> function, so it reports the sum of the numbers in the
        input list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Test your code by calling your <code>non_gauss_add</code> function in the global frame by passing <code>numbers</code> into the function. If working correctly, the vode should set the <code>numbers</code> global variable to a list of numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>, where <code>n</code> is a number that we will change when running timing experiments. Run the code and check that you get the correct sum. Like so:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="hljs livecodeserver">
            n = 40000 # Change this global variable
            numbers = list(range(1, n+1))
            non_gauss_add(numbers)
        </code>
    </pre>

        Summing the numbers one by one gives us the correct output, but could it be more efficient? The answer is yes! We
        can follow in the footsteps of the young Johann Carl
        Friedrich Gauss, a now-revered 18th century mathematician. As the
        story goes, he was punished by his elementary
        school teacher to do the same exercise: add all the
        numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>100</code>.
        The teacher, J. G. B&uuml;ttner, assumed that the problem
        would take Gauss a long time to do, yet Gauss finished
        the problem in a matter of seconds. He realized that,
        adding <code>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100</code> was the same as
        adding <code>(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) + ... + (50 + 51)</code>.
        Each pair summed up to <code>101</code>, and there were
        <code>50</code> of these pairs, so he quickly deduced that the
        answer was &nbsp;<code>101 &times; 50 = 5050</code>.
        Presumably, teacher B&uuml;ttner wasn't pleased.
    </p>
    <p class="alert quoteOrange">
        In general, if you wanted to add the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code>, the answer would be
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>(N + 1) &times; (N &divide; 2)</code>,
        <br>
        because there are <code>(N &divide; 2)</code> pairs, each of which add up to <code>(N + 1)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Complete the body of the <code>gauss_add</code> function, so it reports the sum of a list containing the numbers 1 to <code>N</code> using Gauss's algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine that you are playing a game against young Gauss to see who could add numbers from <code>1</code> to
        <code>N</code> faster:
        he does it his way, while you manually add them one by one. You can either win, lose, or tie in this game.
        What do you think would happen if <code>N</code> is <code>2</code>? If <code>N</code> is <code>10</code>?
        If <code>N</code> is <code>100</code>? If <code>N</code> is one million?
    </p>
    <p>
        On the next page we will use the <code>timeit</code> method in Python to quantify our belief of which algorithm is faster.
