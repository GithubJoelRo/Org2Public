        The next few pages deals with the tic tac toe game and its related files. If you have not done so already, take
        a look at the code for the tic tac toe game to get an idea for what is going on.
    </p>

    <p> In this implementation of tic tac toe, wee are going to focus on how we can
        use classes and objects to render a board and update it as players play a game of Tic Tac Toe.
        Looking at the provided Game and Player classes, we see the connection between the functionality of the two
        classes -- we use the Player objects in our Game. The Player class simply has a constructor method which
        instantiates a Player and assigns it to either "x" or "o", while the Game class has 6 different methods: the
        <code>__init__ method, update, game_click, draw_board, curr_player_win, and no_moves_left </code>. We are going
        to take a
        further look into what each of these methods do and how we might go about implementing them, focusing on
        instance attributes and how we change them.
        ​
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>__init__</code> method and the update method have been provided for you and looking at the body of the
        methods, we
        can see that a Game is initalized with 2 players and a defualt empty board, and player1 always starts first. We
        see in the update method that it simply changes whose turn it now is based on whoever the previous player was.
        The interaction between the Player class and Game class is clear here as we see the Game class using and
        accessing instance variables from the Players passed in.
        ​</p>
    <p>
        The <code>game_click</code> method has an actual behavior in the sense that it will actually take in a
        "coordiante" as an
        argument and update the board accordingly with the current player's piece. When writing your solution, think
        about how boards are represented and how we might access the board variable of the Game and how we might figure
        out which piece to put in that specified location depending on who the current player is. We will go more in
        depth into how this function was implemented and how it works with the board represenation in the next page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>draw_board</code> method has a side effect of actually drawing the board that was created depending on
        whose turn
        it
        just was and the move they made. The board drawing should reflect what the board currently looks like (think
        about
        how you could access the board in a Game).
    </p>
    <p>The <code>curr_player_win</code> method should return True or False based on whether or not the current player is
        able to win
        in
        the current state of the board. Remember a player can win with any winning tripe (horizontal, vertical,
        diagonal)
        With respect to the loop in the game, where might we want to put this method? Think about what its functionality
        is
        -- what should the current player do if there is a winning move for them?
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the <code>no_moves_left</code> method will tell the user whether or not there are any remaining moves.
        At this
        point,
        what should the board look like if there are still moves? And if there are no more moves? Think about the
        representation of the board and what its values should be if there can still be moves made in the Game and what
        the
        values should be if neither player can make a move. (Hint: there are no more moves when a board is full).
