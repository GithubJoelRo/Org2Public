          Say we want to write code to represent books. One way to go about this is to have an overarching class BOOK, each instance of which is one particular book. Now, let's think about some characteristics that we want every single book instance we create to have. The technical term for such a characteristic is a class attribute, because it is shared by every instance of our class; that is, it does not vary from one book to the next. For example, let's say we want every single book to be: 1) Written in English 2) In great condition.

          At this point, our Python code would look something like the following:
           <pre><code>
class Book:
    language = 'English'
    worn_down = False
           </code></pre>
         </p>
          <p>
            <h3>A few things to notice:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Now by default, all the books will be written in English and won't be worn down!</li>
                <li>We capitalize <em>Book</em>, and class names in general, to follow proper coding conventions</li>
                <li>We can assign values to our class attributes (these values can be altered, but we will talk about how to do that later).</li>
              </ol>
          </p>
