# CS10 Lab Development Curriculum
September 5th, 2019

## Introduction
Hello there! This document is intended to be an introduction/guide for lab development. 
The idea is that you can use this to learn development at your own pace, use it as a structure
for the lab development program as a TA, or reviving it in case it loses traction in the near future.
While the curriculum uses "weeks". This isn't a strict schedule but more of a general recommendation for the progression
you should follow.

## Curriculum Overview:

### Week 1: Getting Started
Goals:
* Getting Git setup.
  * Creating a github account if you don't have one.
  * Setting up your fork or adding yourself to a shared one.
* Learning how CS10 labs are structured

More to be added soon.
