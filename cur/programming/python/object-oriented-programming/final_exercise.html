			Okay, now that you've learned the basics of object-oriented programming in Python, it is time for you to create your very own class! If you look below your Textbook class, you'll see the class MemePage. Your job is to fill it out!
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The MemePage class represents one of the many meme pages on the internet. Your job is to fill out the following to-do list so people actually want to post memes on it, and so it has all of the properties of a proper meme page. </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	<h3>To-Do</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			The following class attributes:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					<em>members</em>, initialized to 10000
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>topic</em>, initialized to 'memes'
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>posts</em>, intialized to an empty dictionary
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			A constructor method which does the following:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					Sets an instance attribute <em>name</em> to the input parameter of the same name
				</li>
				<li>
					Sets two instance attributes <em>activity</em> and <em>posts</em> both to 0.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sets an instance attribute <em>member</em> to True
				</li>
				<li>
					Increases the class attribute <em>members</em> by 1
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			Completion of the <em>tag_your_friend_in_meme</em> so that it does the following:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					If the input parameter <em>friend</em> is not an instance of the MemePage class, returns string: 'You cannot tag someone in a meme if they are not a member of this page.' (Hint: You can use <em>isinstance(object, class)</em> to check if an object is an instance of a class)
				</li>
				<li>
					Otherwise it increases your activity (not your friend's) by 1 and returns the string: '@ [insert friend's name here] tagged!'
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>

		<li>
			Completion of the method post_in_page so that it does the following:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					If the parameter of <em>title_of_post</em> already exists as a key inside the class attribute <em>posts</em>, returns the string, 'You have been banned for reposting a meme.'
				</li>
				<li>
					Otherwise, it adds the <em>title_of_post</em> as a key inside the class attribute <em>posts</em>, with the value initialized to 0 (corresponding to the number of likes so far). It increases your activity and posts each by 1. It also returns the string 'Your total activity on this [insert the topic of the meme page here] page is [insert your activity value here], and your total posts to it is now [insert your posts value here].'
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>

		<li>
			Completion of the method <em>like_a_post_in_page</em> so that it does the following:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					Increases your activity by 1
				</li>
				<li>
					Increases the value of the key which corresponds to the post's title in the class attribute <em>posts</em> by 1.
				</li>
				<li>
					Returns the string 'Your total activity on this [insert the topic of the meme page here] page is [insert your activity value here, and the total number of likes on the post <br> [insert title_of_post] is [insert number of likes].'
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<p>
		Congratulations! You have just built your very own class!
