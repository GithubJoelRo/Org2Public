</head><body>So we made our three main strategy blocks: one to take the winning move, one to block the opponent's winning move, and one to take the best free square. Now that we have our three primary strategies for the computer, it's time to put them all together.<br><br>Make the block <span style="font-style: italic;">ttt-choose</span>, which the main block, <span style="font-style: italic;">ttt</span>, will contain, that goes through each strategy. If a strategy does not return false, then the computer should use that strategy to make its next move. ttt-choose takes in two inputs, triples and the computer's piece. (X or O). It should return the best move.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="ttt-choose" alt="ttt-choose" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-choose-block.png" ><br></div><br></body></html>
