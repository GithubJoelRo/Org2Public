		In this activity, you will make a movie or a play.
		<br>
		<br>
		In general, your movie should have at least:
		<br>
		- One block that we did not use during lab.
		<br>
		- Two characters.
		<br>
		- Ten total broadcasts of messages.
		<br>
		<br>
		The activity is open to your creativity -- tell a story, create characters, experiment with moving sprites around stage.
