        <h3>Starter File</h3>
        <p>
            Refer to the previous lab for instructions on how to open and use a shell application (terminal for Mac/Linux users and the CMD command prompt for Windows users).  Once you have a shell up and running, <code>cd</code> into your documents directory and use <code>mkdir PythonLab2</code> to create a new directory called PythonLab2. Use <code>cd PythonLab2</code> to enter the directory. Open your text editor (<code>subl .</code> for Sublime; <code>atom .</code> for Atom), create a file named <code>lab2.py</code>, and save it to the PythonLab2 directory. Save this file: <a href="/bjc-r/prog/python/python2/autograder.py">autograder.py</a> to the PythonLab2 directory as well. You can test your functions as you go by running <code>python3 autograder.py lab2.py</code> in the PythonLab2 directory.
        </p>
        <h3>Exercise 1: Push First Odd Back</h3>
        <p>
            Fill out the function <code>push_first_odd_back</code> under exercise 1 in the starter file.  This function should place the first odd number at the back of the input list. Do not return a new list - in fact this function shouldn't return anything, it should only modify the input list (remember when we talked about mutability a few pages back?). Hint: Just because the previous page was all about the <code>for</code> keyword doesn't necessarily mean that this is the right approach for this problem. Don't forget about <code>while</code>.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> input = [10, 2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> push_first_odd_back(input)
>>> input
[10, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 7]
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
            To test this function using our tests enter the command:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
python3 PythonLab2.py 1
        </code></pre></p>
        <!-- Held to shorten lab
        <h3>Challenge Exercise 1: merge</h3>
        <p>
            Write the function <code>merge</code>, found in the challenge exercise section of the starter file.  This should recursively merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.  To test this function enter:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
python3 PythonLab2.py C1
        </code></pre></p>
        <h3>Challenge Exercise 1b: recursive push_first_odd_back</h3>
        <p>
            Rewrite your <code>push_first_odd_back</code> so that it is recursive. Hint: You'll need a helper function. Hint #2: Your helper function will need two inputs: a list and an index.
