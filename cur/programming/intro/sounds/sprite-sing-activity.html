        	<strong>Activity</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        	Your first task is to make a sprite sing (or make some noise)! All the singing related blocks can be found under the Sound tab. Feel free to change the default numbers in the blocks as you see fit.
        </p>
    	<p>
    		While you are working on this, practice connecting and disconnecting blocks. Also practice how to remove a block from inside a long script.
