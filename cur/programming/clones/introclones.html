        <p>
        What if we wanted to use the same programming code for different sprites in Snap<em>!</em> ?
        We can use the clones feature in Snap<em>!</em> to create clones of the sprite, and we can use the clones to do cool stuff (e.g. move around, interacting with other sprites) without affecting the original sprite. Clones reduce the need to create tons of sprites that performs the same function, and we can use various commands for the clone, such as deleting it or moving it.
