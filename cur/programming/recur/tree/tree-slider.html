			Now that you've finished writing your recursive tree function, it's time to have some fun!
			We're going to introduce you to a really cool feature, the input slider! Here's how you activate it.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Make sure you have these settings checked off. You can toggle "Execute on slider change" when you have
			toggled on "Input sliders".
			<br>

		width="250" height ="400">
		<br>
			<p>
			Now click on the "levels" input on your block and slide the bar that pops up underneath!
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			You should notice your tree doing something pretty cool... like this!

		<br>
		<p>
			You might notice your code running really slowly when you slide really far right.
			This is because the runtime of the tree block is 2<sup>n</sup>, so larger input will take significantly longer to draw than smaller inputs.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now you're probably thinking, "Wow! This is pretty cool!" Or you might be completely unamused.
			But you're probably also wondering why this is even useful? For your midterm and final, you can
			expect to have an in-lab final involving some kind of fractal; having the input slider can let you
			quickly test your code by sliding instead of having to type and delete over and over again.
