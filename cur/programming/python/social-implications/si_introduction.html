        <p>
          Welcome to Lab 19, CS10's social implications session! Today we'll be exploring algorithmic bias, a tricky topic that is becoming increasingly relevant in the practice of computer science and data science. For these activities, we will be working in a slightly different environment (Jupyter notebooks, similar to what you saw in Lab 18). Follow the steps below to get everything set up properly. IMPORTANT: If you have not yet completed Lab 18, please look it over before attempting to complete this lab.
          </p>
          <p>
          To get started on this lab:
          <ul>
          <li>Download the zip folder containing the contents of this lab by clicking this link: <a href="/bjc-r/prog/python/[CS10]SI_Session.zip">CS10 SI Session</a>
          </li>
          <li>Unzip the folder
          </li>
          <li>In the folder you should see the files: <code>CS10_SI_Session.ipynb</code>, <code>doc_data.py</code>
          </li>
          <li>Go to <a href="http://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/home">datahub.berkeley.edu</a>
          </li>
          <li>Login using your Calnet credentials
          </li>
          <li>On the top right there is an upload button. Upload each file in the "[CS10]SI_Session" folder. Note: do NOT change the name of the python file; it must be called "doc_data.py" for the notebook code to execute.
          </li>
          <li>Double click on the <code>CS10_SI_Session.ipynb</code> file to get started!
          </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>If you need help with any of the steps listed above, make sure to ask a staff member. There are no more instructions here. The rest of the instructions for this lab are in the <code>CS10_SI_Session.ipynb</code> that you just opened.</p>
