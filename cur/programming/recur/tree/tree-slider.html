			Now that you've finished writing your recursive tree function, it's time to have some fun!
			We're going to introduce you to a really cool feature, the input slider! Here's how you activate it.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Make sure you have these settings checked off. You can toggle "Execute on slider change" when you have
			toggled on "Input sliders".

		width="250" height ="400">
		<br>
			<p>
			Now click on the "levels" input on your block and slide the bar that pops up underneath!
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			You should notice your tree doing something pretty cool... like this!

		<br>
		<p>
			You might notice your code running really slowly when you slide really far right.
			This is because the runtime of the tree block is exponential, so larger input will take significantly longer to draw than smaller inputs.
