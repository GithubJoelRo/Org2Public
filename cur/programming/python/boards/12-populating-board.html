<p>Remember the board type we made? Let's start using it to store information.</p>
<p>What is involved in putting something on our board? We need to do TWO things in this function: (a) set an item on the board itself, and (b) display the change. Let's write the <code>create_item(object, row, col)</code> function, which will do both of these things for us. We have several objects that we want to be able to place on the board; //?check out the costumes.</p>
<p>You'll find these functions helpful:</p>
<pre><code>
  set_item(row, col, board, item):
    board[row][col] = item
</pre></code>
<pre><code>
  go_to(coord): 
  //might need to change since pygame/turtle have functions for this
    go_to_row_col(row_of_coord(coord), col_of_coord(coord))
</pre></code>
<pre><code>
  draw_object(object, row, col):
    //include this?
    //NOT COMPLETE
    go_to_row_col(row, col)
    turtle.penup()
</pre></code>
<p>(Hint: the idea behind displaying our object is that we should first go to the correct coordinate on the board, and draw on object at that coordinate)</p>
<p>Alright, head to the next page when you think you have your answer.</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Write the <code>create_item(object, row, col)</code> block as described.</p>
