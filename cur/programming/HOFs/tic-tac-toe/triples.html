</head><body> When we look at a tic-tac-toe board, we look at each row, column, and diagonal. Essentially the question is "are there three squares in a line that contain two pieces that are mine with one square empty?" In fact nothing really matters about the game besides the potential winning combinations.
<p> There are eight winning combinations in tic-tac-toe. By looking at our previous board: </p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="There should be an image here" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/tic-tac-toe-board.png" ></div>

<p></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="There should be an image here" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-8-lists.png" ></div>
<p> Take a minute to convince yourself that this list is all you need to know about the corresponding board position. Once the strategy finds the triples for a board position, it never needs to look back at the original position again.</p>   </body></html>
