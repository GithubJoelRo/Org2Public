        <h3>Exercise 3: List All Satisfying Numbers</h3>
        <p>
            In the last two exercises we had you create two functions <code>list_all_factorions_between</code> and <code>list_all_pandigital_between</code>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The functionality of these functions (and, probably, your implementations of them) bear a striking resemblance to one another.
            Computer scientists love generalization, so let's make a function that can accomplish the duties of both
            of the above blocks. Since the main difference between the two is what predicate (<code>is_factorion</code> or <code>is_pandigital</code>) they use, we'll add that as in input.
        </p>

        <p><pre><code>
def list_satisfying_numbers_between(predicate, start, end):
    pass
    </code></pre></p>

    Fill out the function <code>list_satisfying_numbers_between</code> under exercise 3 in the starter file.  The function definition is shown above. It takes in a predicate, start and end of the range of numbers to check. Notice that this functin takes in a predicate as an input. This makes it a Higher Order Function! Passing in a function as an input is easy in Python. Example calls to <code>list_satisfying_numbers_between</code> are shown below.

    <p>
        <b>Hint:</b> Your implementation will be very similar to <code>list_all_factorions_between</code> and <code>list_all_pandigital_between</code>
    </p>

    <p><pre><code>
>>>list_satisfying_numbers_between(is_pandigital, 1, 135)
    [1, 12, 21, 123 , 132]
>>>list_satisfying_numbers_between(is_factorial, 1, 150)
    [1, 2, 145]
    </code></pre></p>
<p>
To test this function, run:
</p>

<p><pre><code>
python3 autograder.py lab3.py 3
</code></pre></p>
        
        <p>
            Now, imagine you're given a new predicate, such as:
        </p>
        
        <p><pre><code>
def is_even(num):
    if (num % 2) == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
    </code></pre></p>
        
        <p>
            and want to write the function <code>list_all_even_between</code>...
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Wait! Doesn't this sound pretty familiar? This problem can be easily solved using the general block we just created
            (you don't actually have to solve this one)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The beauty of abstraction: build once, use over and over again! When we wrote the <code>list_satisfying_numbers_between</code> block, we didn't know
            that we'd ever want to list even numbers! But since we generalized properly, we were able to use the block to solve a future problem.
