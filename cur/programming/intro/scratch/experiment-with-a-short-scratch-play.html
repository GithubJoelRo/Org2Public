		<h2>Scripts</h2>The "play sound" blocks and short script examples from the last page played in order; one block and then the next until there are no more blocks to play. Although, we did see that what we actually heard depended on whether we waited until one sound was done playing or not.
		<br>
		<br>
		The "broadcast" block allows us to control which block is played next. Try to make these scripts in Scratch. You will find that the Cat and the Duck have completely separate script areas. Click on each character to see their script area. Once you are done, press the green flag to start the short play.

		A note about style: You will notice that we chose to name the messages that were broadcast so that it would help us keep track of what we were doing and what messages we were sending. We recommend that you do this in your projects! <h2>Hints</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				To choose a new sprite from a library of existing sprites, click on the icon below the stage that looks like a folder.

				<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/sys-create-new-sprite-BYOB.jpg" alt="New Sprite" title="New Sprite" >
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>
				Try to figure out what the commands (whose images are on the left) and buttons (whose images are on the right) do. These will be helpful to get the characters to face each other.
