        Looking back at the game loop, something happens in the game when the event <code>MOUSEBUTTONUP</code> happens.
        When
        we sense that the mouse button as been clicked and the player has let go of the mouse button, we want to log the
        x,y
        coordinates of the mouse and pass it through the function <code>Game().game_click(x,y)</code>.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
running = True
while running:
    
    for event in pg.event.get():
        # Did the user click the window close button?
        if event.type == pg.QUIT:
            running = False
        # is the player clicking on the screen right now?
        if event.type == pg.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
            x,y = pg.mouse.get_pos()
            ttt_game.game_click(x, y)
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        Let's take a more in depth look at the <code>game_click function</code> To understand how the game_click
        function works, remember that our tic-tac-toe board is being represented as a list. As such, the indexes of the
        list coresponds to coordinates like so:
    </p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/board_rep.png" width="600" height="500">

    </div>

    <p>
        There are multiple ways to use lists to represent a board, such as the <a
            href="https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/cur/programming/lists/hof/ttt/10-your-board.html?topic=berkeley_bjc%2Flists%2Ftic-tac-toe.topic&course=cs10_fa20.html&novideo&noreading&noassignment"
            target="_blank">2D list array used in the boards lab.</a> The way that the board is implemented in TTT is
        the same way the board was impleneted in the Pytris project. If you have trouble understanding this board
        representation works, refer back to your code for Pytris for some extra clarification.
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>
def game_click(self, x, y):


    if x <= self.length * (1/3):
        x_coor = 0
    elif x <= self.length * (2/3):
        x_coor = 1
    else:
        x_coor = 2

    if y <= self.length * (1/3):
        y_coor = 0
    elif y <= self.length * (2/3):
        y_coor = 1
    else:
        y_coor = 2

    index = ((y_coor * 3) + x_coor ) 


    if self.board[index] == None:

        self.board[index] = self.curr_turn

        self.switch_players = True
    </code>
</pre>

    <p>
        The inputs of <code>game_click(x,y)</code> are physical x, y coordinates on the pygame screen. In pygame, (0,0)
        starts at the top left corder of the screen. The y coordinates grow in a positive direction going towards the
        right side of the screen, and the y coordinates grows positvely when going towards the botom of the screen.
    </p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/pygame_screen.png" width="500" height="500">
    </div>

    <p>
        The <code>game_click</code>> function takes in a set of screen coordinates. In this tic-tac-toe game, the height
        of the screen is 300, and the width is also 300. The game board spans the entire width and length of the screen.
        With this information, it is possible to go from
        <code>x,y coordinates -> col, row coordinate -> list index</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        To go from x,y coordinate to row, col coordinate, we have to recognize the boundries of the for col = 0 is when
        x is between 0 and 100, boundries for col = 1 is when x is between 100 and 200, and the boundries for col = 2 is
        when x is between 200 and 300. This process is exactly the same for determining the col coordinate from y. Once
        we have the col,row coordinate, we can use the index equation from the pytris project to find the index of the
        list using the col,row coordinate: <code>index = ((y_coor * 3) + x_coor )</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rest of the code for <code>game_click</code> makes sure thatwe are only writing to the board if that
        position is empty and not already filled√ü
