			Now that you've finished writing your recursive tree function, it's time to have some fun!
			We're going to introduce you to a really cool feature, the input slider! Here's how you activate it.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			First, go to your options and click on input slider.
			<br>
		</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/Input-Slider.png" alt="" title="There should be an image here" 
		width="400" height ="200">

		<p>
			Then, go back to your options and click on "Execute on Slider Change" so that your block runs
			automatically on changes.
			<br>

		</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/slider_change.png" alt="" title="" width="400" height="150">
		<br>
		<p>
			Finally, go back to options again, and activate turbo mode so the trees load more quickly.
			<br>

		<p>

		<br>
			Sweet! Now click on your tree block where you would normally put in your "levels" input and you
			should notice a gray bar pop up. That's the slider! Try clicking on black oval and sliding it left and right.
			<br>
		</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/use_slider.png" alt="" title="" width="400" height="100">
		<br>
		<p>
			You might notice your code running really slowly when you slide really far right.
			This is because the runtime of the tree block is 2<sup>n</sup>, so larger input will take significantly longer to draw than smaller inputs.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now you're probably thinking, "Wow! This is pretty cool!" Or you might be completely unamused.
			But you're probably also wondering why this is even useful? For your midterm and final, you can
			expect to have an in-lab final involving some kind of fractal; having the input slider can let you
			quickly test your code by sliding instead of having to type and delete over and over again.
