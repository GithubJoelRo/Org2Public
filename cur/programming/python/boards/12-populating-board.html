<p>Remember the board type we made? Let's start using it to store information.</p>
<p>What is involved in putting something on our board? We need to do TWO things in this function: (a) set an item on the board itself, and (b) display the change. Let's write the <code>create_item(object, row, col)</code> function, which will do both of these things for us. The turtle library has a few options for turtle shapes, these shape names include "arrow", "turtle", "circle", "square", "triangle", "classic".</p>
<p>You'll find these functions helpful:</p>
<pre><code>
  set_item(item, row, col):
    BOARD[row][col] = item
</pre></code>
<pre><code>
  def find_x_y(row, col):
    x = (START[0] + STEP * col) + (STEP / 2)
    y = (START[1] - STEP * row) - (STEP / 2)
    return (x, y)
</pre></code>
<pre><code>
  def draw_obj(obje, row, col):
    obj = turtle.Turtle()
    obj.penup()
    obj.goto(find_x_y(row, col))
    obj.shape(obje) # obje parameter is a string that represents the type of turtle head shape
    obj.color("red") # you can pass in other color names as well
    obj.shapesize(0.50, 0.50)
</pre></code>
<p>(Hint: the idea behind displaying our object is that we should first go to the correct coordinate on the board, and draw on object at that coordinate)</p>
<p>Alright, head to the next page when you think you have your answer.</p>
