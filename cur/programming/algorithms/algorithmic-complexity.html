            In this lab, you will learn that some ways to solve a problem are faster than others. We will use a timer in Snap<em>!</em> to see explore the efficiency of different Algorithms.  However, remember that we don't measure efficiency by the time it takes an algorithm to run because this would be an unreliable measurement. Instead we look at the relationship between the number of steps an algoirthm takes as a function of its inputs. The graph above shows the run-times we will consider in this class. We use abstraction when considering run-time by looking at the order of growth, also known as the dominant term of this functional relation.
