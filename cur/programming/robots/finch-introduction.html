            Snap<em>!</em> has the ability to connect to several kinds of robots. One relatively simple, but also
            very useful such robot is called the <a href="http://www.finchrobot.com">Finch</a>.
            As you will see in this lab, the finch has both input and output capabilities
            that make it a very versatile little machine. You won't actually write much code in this lab - you'll be given examples of
            what the finch can do, asked to understand the code, and make small modifications to what it does. Hopefully, these activities
            will inspire you to use the finch to do awesome things on your project!
