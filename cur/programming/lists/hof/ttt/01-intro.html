<h3>Introduction, and Asking Questions</h3>
<p>
  First things first, you're going to need the <a class='run' href='/bjc-r/prog/lists/tic-tac-toe_lab_starter_very_new.xml'>starter file</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  Now, try clicking the green flag to play the game against the AI! You'll notice that for an AI, it's a little... unintelligent. In the first part of this lab, you'll be upgrading the AI by building the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/next-move-for-computer.png" alt="list of winning combinations" width="20%" height="20%"/> block that will help choose the most optimal spot for the AI to select.
</p>

<p>
  Here's what we'd like out of the block:
  <ul>
    <li>Inputs: the current state of the game, and whether the computer is playing X or O.</li>
    <li>Output: where the computer should move.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  If those don't sound super defined (<em>current state</em>, <em>where to move</em>), don't worry- we'll define them on the next page together.
</p>

  <div class="prompt">
     <p>
       Before we begin, what are some good questions to ask for building the tic-tac-toe AI?
     </p>
  </div>

  <div class="choice" identifier="c1">
     <div class="text">How do you win tic-tac-toe?</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         We should definitely ask this question. Our <code>ttt</code> block should work toward satisfying the answer to this question. What else could we ask?
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="choice" identifier="c2">
     <div class="text">What constitutes a good move?</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         This is definitely an important question; the <code>ttt</code> block's implementation will depend on the strategy we're going for. What other questions could we ask?
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="choice" identifier="c3">
     <div class="text">What do I want my tic-tac-toe block to accomplish?</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         Yes, clearly defining the inputs and outputs of our <code>ttt</code> block is necessary before we begin writing anything. What else could we ask?
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="choice" identifier="c4">
     <div class="text">All of the above are good questions you should ask.</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         Correct!
     </div>
  </div>
