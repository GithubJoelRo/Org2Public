    <body>
        Defining a function in Python is easy! Compare the Snap<em>!</em> program on the left with its Python equivalent on the right. Both programs take an integer as an argument, and print out all the numbers between 1 and that number.
        <table style="width:auto; table-height:200px">
                  <tr>
                      <td>
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/edday/count_up_function.png"/>
                      </td>
                      <td>                          
                          <img src="/bjc-r/img/edday/count_up_function_python.png"/>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
              </table>
              <p>
                  <b>Function definition:</b> Like in Snap<em>!</em>, a function is separated into two parts. The first part is the function header, which specifies the name of the function, and any arguments (a.k.a. input variables, parameters) of the function. Notice that in Python, the line must begin with the keyword <code>def</code> and end with a <code>:</code>. This lets the Python interpreter know that the indented lines are a function header. The second part of a function is the function body. Notice that the two bodies look very similar.

              <p class="alert alert-warning quoteOrange">In Snap<em>!</em> it's common to have text between function parameters, such as the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="Snap! mod block" />. In Python, all parameters must come at the end of a function, between parentheses<code>()</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <b><code>For</code> Loop:</b> The <code>for</code> loop in Python works similarly to our Snap<em>!</em> <code>for</code> loop with some key differences. To have the index variable <code>i</code> increment from <code>1 to num</code>, we have to create an <b>iterable</b>. For now, think of an iterable as anything that can act like a list of items. Starting with the first item, <code>i</code> takes each consecutive item of the list as its value. The <code>range(x, y)</code> function receives two numbers and returns an iterable of all numbers beginning with <code>x</code> and ending with <code>y-1</code>.

              <p>In file: <code>Lab1.py</code></p>
              <p><pre><code>
def count_up(num):
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        print(i)
              </code></pre></p>
              <p>Run <code>python -i Lab1.py</code></p>
              <pre><code>
>>> count_up(4)
1
2
3
4
>>>
            </code></pre>
            <p class="alert alert-warning quoteOrange">
                Make sure you notice: The iterable returned by range(x,y) does NOT include y. For this reason, if we want the count-up to include the input <code>num</code>, the <code>count_up</code> function must use a range that goes from <code>1</code> to <code>num + 1</code>.
