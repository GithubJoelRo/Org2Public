        <p>
         The purpose of this lab is to provide you with a brief introduction to OOP in Python, which you will encounter in programming heavily in the future.<br>
         The Python object system is built around classes and instances.
          </p>

          <p>
          Let's start by considering a hypothetical type of object we might like to create. Then, we will look at the example code and work through it step-by-step as we introduce relevant aspects of the object system. Next, you will expand our class on your own as practice. Finally, we will finish the lab off by having you implement your very own class!
