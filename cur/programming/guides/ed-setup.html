	<h1>Introduction to Ed and Discord</h1>
	<p>
	    In this course, we will be using Ed, an online discussion forum. We automatically enroll everyone on <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/8795/discussion/">CS10's Ed</a>. Please contact us if you have not been added! Ed is a forum for you to discuss with your fellow classmates things that you have questions about. 
	</p>

	  <p>
		  This semester, we will also be using Discord to facilitate labs and Office Hours. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iZFoppiCWuq64H4khDXgYk9K5vExu563VuaoApHUYs0/edit">HERE</a> is a doc to help you get started with Discord, as well as get you into the CS10 server.
