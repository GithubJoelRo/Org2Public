        If you haven't done so already, take a look at the files for the Frogger game! The remainder of the guide will talk about different aspects of the Frogger game. Try to understand the Obstacles,
        Game, and Frog classes and how they interact with each other.
    </p>

    <p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is particularly useful when it comes to game design, not only due to the
        easiness to
        organize and collaborate, but due to games' inherent nature--the interaction between different objects!</p>

    <p>Because this method of programming focuses on the creation of objects along with its attributes and behaviors, we
        are
        able to easily work with different objects within the game in organized manner. Furthermore, with the power of
        inheritance and interaction between the different classes and their subclasses, it prevents things such as
        repetition in
        code, because you can easily reuse and/or override methods that you've written under those classes.
    </p>

    <p>An important thing to note is that that we are able to split our code into multiple files. Each file would
        usually
        comprise of its own class, and with a certain syntax, we are able to make all of the classes within our program
        interact
        with one another as if they are in the same file.</p>

    <p>In order to do this, you have to make sure that the files comprised of your different classes are within the same
        directory or folder. By doing so, you could import one or more classes' components onto that of another file
        containing
        a different class, allowing you to utilize features from those imported class.</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="hljs livecodeserver">
import pygame as pg
import random

class Obstacle(pg.sprite.Sprite):

    # lane_num: the number lane that the obstacle will be in
    # screen_width: width of the game screen 
    # screen_height: height of the game screen 
    # direction: either 1 or -1 for how the block should be moving
    # speed: how fast we want the object to move, higher number == faster speed
    # img_path: the location of the image of the car. Is a string
    # car_size: tuple with the dimensions of the car object: (Width, Height)

    def __init__(self, lane_num, screen_width, screen_height, direction, speed, img_path, car_size):
        pg.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.lane_num = lane_num
        
        self.width = car_size[0]
        self.height = car_size[1]
        
        self.screen_width = screen_width
        self.screen_height = screen_height
        
        self.finished = False
        self.direction = direction

        if self.direction == 1:
            self.image = pg.transform.scale(pg.image.load(img_path), car_size)
        else:
            self.image = pg.transform.flip(pg.transform.scale(pg.image.load(img_path), car_size), True, False)

        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.move_x = 0

        self.speed = speed
    </code>
        </pre>

    <p>As you can see, in the Game.py file, we could utilize components from the Obstacles class by including "from
        Obstacles
        import Obstacle," where "Obstacles" is the Obstacles.py file and "Obstacle" is the name of the class. If you
        want to
        import everything from a particular file or even a library such as pygame, you would simply type "from pygame
        import *".</p>

    <p>And voila! You have access to the different methods and instances (objects) of that imported class, allowing for
        efficient interaction between the different classes!</p>

    <p>Ultimately, it is up to you and your design to decide which classes are necessary, and what methods and instance
        variables should each class have. Good design decisions could make your game more manageable and easier to
        debug.
        However, it is completely ok if your first design turns out unsatisfactory - it often takes several iterations
        to
        achieve the optimal design, so do not be afraid to make modifications to your design as you work on the project.
    </p>

    <p>We hope that Frogger could give you an idea as to how you can break down a complex game and organize each
        component into
        a class. We want to emphasize that there are multiple ways of doing this, and in no way is our way the correct
        answer;
        therefore, as you read through the rest of this guide, think about how you could have organized things
        differently!</p>

    <p>For Frogger, we decided that three game components should have their own classes - frog (player), obstacle, and
        lanes
        (Game.py). Before diving into the actual code. Let's think about how these components should be able to handle
        and how
        they should interact.</p>

    <p>For our frog, we want to make sure that it can move in 4 different directions given keyboard inputs; we would
        like to
        return the frog to its starting position if it collided with an obstacle; we want the frog to identify that it
        has made
        it across all the traffic lanes safely; and finally, we need to display the frog.</p>

    <p>For each obstacle, it should be able to move at varying speeds; it should be able to detect that it has moved
        past the
        edges of the screen and signal that; and it should be displayed on screen.</p>


    <pre>
        <code class="hljs livecodeserver">
import pygame as pg
import pygame.freetype as freetype
import random
import os
from Game import Game
from Frog import Frog
from Obstacles import Obstacle



# Simple pygame program
screen_width = 700
screen_height = 600
num_lanes = 4

# Import and initialize the pygame library
pg.init()

# Set up the drawing window
screen = pg.display.set_mode([screen_width,screen_height])

f_game = Game(4,3)

</code>
    </pre>

    <p>With the big picture set, let's look more closely at the code. In particular, we will focus on how the Obstacle
        class
        and Game class interact. In the game loop in main.py, a new Game object is created, and obstacles are created
        and stored
        into the sprite groups</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="hljs livecodeserver">
class Game:

# num_lanes: How many total lanes is wanted in this game, minimum is two for start and end lanes. includes start, end
and traffic lanes
# num_lives: Game over when this number reaches 0
# screen_height: Height of the pygame screen, will be used for some calculations later
# screen_width: Width of the pygame screen, will be used for some calculations later
# obstacle_group: A special class under pygame.sprite.Group() that can store pygame.sprite.Sprite() objects. We will talk more about sprites and groups later in the module

def __init__(self, num_lanes, num_lives, screen_height, screen_width, obstacle_group):
    self.num_lives = num_lives
    self.num_lanes  = num_lanes
    self.screen_height = screen_height
    self.screen_width = screen_width
    self.obstacle_group = obstacle_group

</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Obstacles are stored within the game through the <code>self.obstacle_group</code> variable. In the next page,
        you will learn about sprites and groups in pygame and how they might be useful in building a game. Basically, by
        making obstacles into a sprite, you can access of pygame's useful built-in sprite and group features such as
        collision detection with other sprites and drawing many sprites at one one time with relative ease.

    </p>
    <p>Now, consider if we had not split up the code into different classes. It could become overwhelming to think about
        all
        obstacles that you have to keep track of and all the things you need to check for. However, by creating an
        Obstacle
        class, we only need to think about what a single Obstacle object needs to do. Similarly, the Game class gives us
        a
        useful data structure for storing all the Obstacle objects. Again, there is a lot of flexibility in design. For
        example,
        we could have chosen a different data structure to store the obstacle sprites; or we could have not used sprites
        and created our
        own classes; or we could have done the collisino detection through the game class instead of using pygame's
        built in functions.

    <p>We hope that this guide helps you see the importance and intricacy of design and gets you started on thinking
        about how
        you could componentize your final project!</p>
