  <p>This section is to help you understand the machine model some more, so that you don't get frustrated as you're working on your own projects. There are some subtleties when the same message is broadcast multiple times.</p>
  <p>
    Read the following <em>Snap!</em> scripts:
  </p>

  <img alt="broadcast 'test' three times" src="/bjc-r/img/lab-9/broadcast-three-tests.png" />
  <img alt="broadcast and wait 'test' three times" src="/bjc-r/img/lab-9/broadcast-and-wait-three-tests.png" />
  <img alt="receive 'test' and add item to list" src="/bjc-r/img/lab-9/receive-test.png" />

  <p>What do you think the list <code>some list</code> will look like if we press <code>b</code>? What about if we press <code>w</code>? Discuss with your neighbor. When you're ready, move on to the next page.</p>
